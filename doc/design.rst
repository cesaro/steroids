Runtime
-------

- _rt_XXX functions are public, will hook functions named XXX
- __rt_* are private, the instrumenter will skip them, but they never substitute
  a call to _rt_* or something

- Limitation: the size the log trace cannot be greater than 2^31, as otherwise,
  at the end of a replay sequence, the current.count coulds decrease 2^31 times,
  overflow and become positive.

Synchronization algorithm::

Instrumentation
---------------

- events
- structure rt
- pointers instrumented in the module, pointing to the host's heap:
  static struct rt * const rt; // stored in the Executor object, in the host
  static const uint64_t memstart;
  static const uint64_t memend;
  static const uint64_t evend;

- format of the event stream; at least 1 available
- __rt_{store,load}_pre instrumented before the store; will stop execution if OOM fault
  and record one event
- then the store or the load
- then a call to __rt_{store,load}_post


Guest stack switch
--------------

- Callee-saved: RBP, RBX, and R12â€“R15.
- All others must be saved by the caller if it wishes to preserve their values.

POSIX threads library
---------------------

- Thread/process termination
  We impose that only main can call exit(3).
  We impose that the last thread to finish must be main.
  So main must pthread_join() for any other thread.

- Stacks.
  We allow pthread_attr_{get,set}stack(addr)?, the addresses that we might
  receive have been allocated inside of the guest, so should be safe
  -> Por el momento, no hacemos free() de la pila

- Detached threads.
  For the time being, we do not support them.
  main() has to pthread_join all threads
  Question: can we return to the host from a thread different than main?

- Mutexes.
  We have to keep track of all mutexes currently alive to destroy them before
  the guest terminates.
  Also the mutexes and condvars in the library
